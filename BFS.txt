Push the starting node in the queue Q.
Create a visited array V.

The visited array is of size n. (n here is the number of nodes in the graph)

So, as we traverse the nodes (nodes are supposed marked from 1 to n), 
we make the corresponding index in the array as 1.

Make the adjacency list for all the nodes.

As we start popping the node from the queue, refer the adjacency list
for that node and push the corresponding nodes into the queue.
(Remember to check the visited array to see if a node
has already been visited then no need to add it in the queue again)
