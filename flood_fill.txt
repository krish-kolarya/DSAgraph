We are given a matrix having numbers. Each number means some color. We are also given the starting (row,col) and the color
number (this will be used to color the cells in matrix). So, all the cells having the same color as that in (row,color) will
be changed to the color provided. We use bfs as we have to simultaneously check in all four directions and change color.
Maintain a direction array for all four directions, iterate through this array and keep on calculating the new (row,col)
everytime, check if it is valid and then add it to the queue.
