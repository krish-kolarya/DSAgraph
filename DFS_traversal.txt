In dfs traversal we travel one node at a time. We ensure that all the connected nodes are visited.

First, get the adjacency list. Declare a visited list. Declare a variable for the starting node. 

In the dfs function, mark the current node as visited, add it to the result list and then iterate through the adjacency list
of the node and recursively call the dfs function for any unvisited nodes.

once all the nodes are visited, print the result list.
