In this question we have to find the number of provinces. A province is a group of nodes connected to each other. 
A single node is considered to be one province too. We are provided with the adjacency matrix. We have to find the number 
of provinces in the graph.

Idea: 
The idea is to first convert the matrix into an adjacency list. Then we maintain a visited array and start by traversing it. 
Now when apply dfs on a province, every node of the province is visited and simultaneously marked in the visited array. 
We increase the count by 1 at the end after applying dfs on a province. Now when we traverse the unvisited array and 
encounter any node it means that node is of some other province, we apply dfs on that node. 
we end up marking all the nodes in the new province too. We keep on doing this until we reach the end of the visited array.

The count is the final answer. 
So the number of unvisited nodes we encounter (after applying dfs every time) is the number of provinces.
